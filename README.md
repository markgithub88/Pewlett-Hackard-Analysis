# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

1.	Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We determined which employees are eligible for the mentorship program for the company.  We determined by filtering the table data which retiring titles and then found those retiring titles.  Now we can offer those employees a mentorship.

2.	Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

•	There are 72000 retiring, and 57000 being hired which means there are more than enough retirees to help the new employees.  The company could practice an offset yearly mentorship by the retirees from the previous year mentoring the incoming employees, and every year that number will change

72458
o	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Yes, absolutely.
