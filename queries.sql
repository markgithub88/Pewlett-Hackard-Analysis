/*This time, the change we'll make to the code is also smallâ€”we're modifying the SELECT statement into a SELECT INTO statement. This statement tells Postgres that 
instead of generating a list of results, the data is saved as a new table completely. Update our code to include the INTO portion of the SELECT statement.
Insert a new, blank line between the SELECT and FROM sections of the code. In this vacant space, type in INTO retirement_info. With the addition of this line, 
we're telling Postgres to save the data into a table named "retirement_info." The complete code should look as follows:*/
